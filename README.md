# UrlDataset_Work
This repository contains the work on URLDataset

The urldataset is a dataset which has a lot of urls. We will do logistic regression on the url dataset, decison trees on the dataset and finally integrate weight 
and biases.
Neural networks and other machine learning models have learnable parameters called weights and biases.
**WEIGHTS**
The signal that is, the strength of the connectionâ€”between two neurons is regulated by weights. Stated differently, a weight determines the degree to which an input will affect an output.
**BIASES**
Constant biases are extra inputs that are added to the following layer and are always set to 1. Although bias units have outgoing connections with their weights, they are not affected by the layer above. The bias unit ensures that there will be neuronal activation even in the event that all inputs are zeros.
